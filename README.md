# RegnskapSFI

Every year, we spend about a week on manually creating the accounting report for NFR, piecing together various Excel sheets, projects knowledge, resources engagements, partner engagements, and a bit of magic.
 
This tool  simplify this process for a Center Coordinator (and someone with financial/accounting responsibilities) across SFI, SFF, or other centers.
 
This tool integrates data (exported) from Kuben (UiO accounting system) with centerÂ´s internal information and processes it interactively in one environment, producing the precise report NFR requires.
 
 
The goal? 
- Reduce the report creation time from a week to a day, ensuring both convenience and absolute accuracy.
